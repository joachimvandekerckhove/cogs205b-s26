# Introduction to containerization

The goal of containerization is to ensure consistent and portable computational environments. That is, its goal is to create a computational system that reliably works the same on every computer.  This is especially useful in computational research, where analyses can be complex and depend on a lot of interacting pieces of software and code that may come in many versions.

We will use Docker Desktop to understand the basic ideas and practical applications.

# What is containerization?

Containerization is a way to package software and everything it needs to run into a single "box," called a **container**. This box can be moved to any computer, and the software will run exactly the same way.  Containerization is a lot like [virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization) but tends to be more efficient.

# What is containerization?

You can think of a container a little bit like a parasite that lives inside another computer.  That has a negative connotation, so we will simply call it the **container** and the computer will be the **host**.  A single host can have many containers.

Below, we will also talk about the **image**, which something like a template to make a kind of container.  We can have many images, and each image can spawn many containers.  Often, it's the image we will share to others.

# Everything's in there

When you buy a piece of furniture from IKEA, the package includes everything you need: screws, tools, instructions, and the wooden pieces. Even if you don't have your own tools, you can still assemble the furniture because everything is in the box. Similarly, the **image** provides all the "tools" and "pieces" a program needs to run, so it works the same way on any computer.  The **container** is like the finished piece of furniture.

# Why use containers?

- **Consistency**: Containers ensure the same program works the same way, no matter whose computer it’s on.
- **Portability**: You can move containers between your laptop, a friend's computer, or even powerful online servers.
- **Simplicity**: Containers bundle everything needed, so you don’t have to install things one by one.

# Key concepts and terminology

1. **Images**

- An **image** is like a recipe for making a container.
- It includes the program, its tools, and instructions on how to set everything up.

2. **Containers**

- A **container** is a running version of an image.
- Think of it as the assembled IKEA furniture created from the box's contents.

3. **Docker** and **Docker Desktop**

Docker is a set of services to create containers.  It is a widely used industry standard.  "A docker" is a container made this way.

**Docker Desktop** is the specific application we will use to work with Docker containers using a graphical interface and minimal technical setup.

---

# Key concepts and terminology

Steps to get started:

- Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). 
- Open the application, and follow the setup instructions.
- Verify the installation by running the "Hello World" container (from Docker Desktop).

4. **Registry**

- A **registry** is a library for storing and sharing images.
- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is a public registry where you can find and share containers.

5. **Port mapping**

- A **port** is an entry point to a program running on a computer. Every computer has many ports, some dedicated for particular services, and they are usually closed.
- Port mapping assigns a port on the _host_ computer to a port on the _container_ so you can use its services.

# Key concepts and terminology

6. **Docker Desktop**

Docker Desktop is a tool that makes it easy to create, share, and run containers without needing to write complex commands. It simplifies the process with a visual interface.

- **Graphical interface**: No need to memorize commands; most operations are clickable.
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- **Prebuilt containers**: Access ready-to-use containers for popular programs with just a few clicks.

# Containers are important

Without containers:

- Programs often need specific versions of tools or software to work.
- What works on one computer might not work on another.
- Sharing programs can be tricky because everyone’s computer is set up differently.
- Changing your local setup for one program might break others.


---

# Containers are important

Container solutions:

- **Encapsulation**: Everything the program needs is packaged together.
- **Portability**: Containers run the same way everywhere.
- **Reproducibility**: You can guarantee the same results, no matter where or when the program is run.

# Containers are important

Everyday benefits:

- **For this class**: You can run the same programming environment as I do so my examples will work on your computer and your assignments will work on mine.
- **For students**: You can simulate a computer and if you mess it up you can just start over.
- **For teams**: Everyone works with the same tools, avoiding conflicts.
- **For sharing**: You can send a image to someone, and it will just work.
- **For researchers**: Reviewers and readers can download your Docker image and repeat your analyses.

# Recap

- Containers are like portable "boxes" for programs, ensuring they run the same way everywhere.
- Docker Desktop makes creating and using containers simple and efficient.
- Containers solve problems of consistency, portability, and reproducibility.

---

# Next steps

 - Download and install Docker Desktop on your computer.
 - Run the "Hello World" container to verify your setup.
 - Go to the next chapter
